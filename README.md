While trying my best to build my website, I struggled with Bootstrap a lot since it’s still new to me. Even though it looks easy and the website shares codes of specific elements, examples and explanations on how to do it and how things work, it’s quite confusing and it’s a big learning curve for me. I had to go look through my past assignments about Bootstrap to guide me.  The challenge I faced during the process is that website didn’t look like what it was supposed to look like compared to my live share. Everything looked great in Visual Studio Code but on the website link, my website looked really tiny and weird. I don’t know why my website on my live share is not translating well to the browser and I don’t know how to fix the issue. Also, I found the customization of the Bootstrap elements confusing with CSS. It took me a while to figure it out by playing with it on the css file, changing the color, text, etc… Having to incorporate Bootstrap Grids was really challenging because I tried to include it in my contact page and my about page and it looked really wonky. I tried adding padding on some elements to make it better and balanced but that didin’t worked out.
